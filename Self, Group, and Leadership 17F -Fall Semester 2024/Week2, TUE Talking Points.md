To summarize leadership; leadership is basically an interaction between followers and leaders in the most **efficient way possible**.

> "Some have extended the latter viewpoint so far as to suggest there is no such thing as leadership; they argue that organizational successes and failures often get falsely attributed to the leader, but the situation may have a much greter impact on how the organization functions than does any individual, including the leader."

I mostly agree with this statement, sometimes leaders are not always leaders in the different situations they come across. For example one might require a more physically inclined leader that can actually assist.
